                            We currently have  more  than 8 projects on ground which aim at complete overall development of these underprivileged children with the aim of their complete development and better future. </p3>

                    <h2>What we do</h2>
                    <p>We provide necessary assistance to underprivileged children's learning processes. We believe that these children are the keys to change and upliftment, both in their lives and in India as a whole. When equipped with proper education, they can do miracles. 
                        Humankind provides them with additional assistance after their regular school hours. <span>The children are taught about health, hygiene, the environment, and sanitation</span>. Furthermore, we try to provide guidance for higher education and vocational training to both school-aged youth and community adults.

                <p> Under our initiative, <span> Saksham</span>, Humankind provides vocational training, to begin with, in the trade of tailoring at a centre operating in a rented place in Gandhivas, a “basti” of hundreds of underprivileged families in the Sabarmati area of Ahmedabad.
                    Efforts are afoot to create awareness of and <span>concern for the environment</span>.
                <br>
                    Besides, the children are introduced to <span>preliminary financial literacy</span>. Children are taught to cultivate saving habits out of the pocket money they get from their parents. It also helps them wean away from bad habits. For this purpose, Humankind has come up with <span>the idea of the Kids' Bank</span>. Every Sunday, children deposit some amount in this informal bank, which is managed by volunteers with the help of senior students.</p2>

        <p>It is worth mentioning that Humankind does the above work <span>with the help of unpaid volunteers working on honorary basis</span>. These volunteers are drawn from the retired or working concerned citizens, the students who passed out of school and were beneficiaries of the services rendered by Humankind and Interns from various colleges. <br>
            When the children reach the ninth and tenth grades, they are enrolled in regular formal coaching classes. Humankind pays 70% of their coaching fees, and they pay the remaining 30%. However, if possible, <span>the beneficiary students are expected to provide 2 hours of voluntary service in Humankind</span> on 6 days per week to help other younger children in their own community. This is how our <span>Humankind family</span> also grows.
           <br> Donations from concerned citizens, business firms, and corporate entities are used to cover recurring operational overhead expenses and capital expenditures.</p>

        <div id="how_we_started">
            <h3>How we started</h3>
            <p>Humankind began its journey in 2009, with only five students from a municipal school in Sabarmati, Ahmedabad.
                Initially, on Sundays, the children were entertained with indoor and outdoor games/sports on the school grounds. The children were gradually taught to keep themselves hygienically clean by taking regular baths, washing their clothes, cutting their nails, keeping their hair tidy, and so on. As the number of children increased, they were persuaded to study under the supervision of Humankind volunteers in order to participate in the games/sports.</p>

            <h3>
                The Journey
            </h3>
            <p>
                After four years of working on the school grounds, a real estate developer noticed the sincerity of Humankind volunteers in their purposeful work. In 2013, he generously offered Humankind the current premises at Nanakram Super Market, Ramnagar, Sabarmati, for its operations. Humankind has been able to provide books, school bags with necessary kit components, and acquire our teaching and learning aids, computers and audio visual equipment, furniture and fittings, and sewing machines thanks to donations from concerned citizens, business firms, and large corporate entities.

            <p>Humankind has about 150 students registered. They are at Humankind from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday, depending on their respective school schedules, and on Sundays from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., for playful fun time.</p>
